## General notes from me about taking the exam:

-   KMS. Literally, everything about KMS. Understand:

	-   API endpoints necessary to encrypt/decrypt/re-encrypt
	-   How to import/re-import key material
	-   When AWS can automatically rotate keys
	-   Deletion policies
	-   Key policies associated with a Customer Master Key
	-   When KMS is a solution vs when Cloud HSM would be a solution

-   Cross account access, inside and out

	-   When to use trusted entities via IAM roles
	-   How to require an externalID via policy conditions
	-   When to use resource/identity policies

-   Understand the difference between AWS Config, Trusted Advisor, and Cloudtrail

	-   They try to trick you between the three
	-   When anything comes up about AUDITING CHANGES TO RESOURCES, it's probably AWS Config
	-   If they ask you about CHECKING FOR OPEN SECURITY GROUPS, OPEN BUCKETS, MFA ON ROOT ACCOUNT, ETC it's probably Trusted Advisor
	-   If they ask you about LOGGING API CALLS OR WHO DOES WHAT, that's probably Cloudtrail

-   What to do when an EC2 instance gets compromised

	-   Do not select anything about logging into the instance. Period.
	-   Do not terminate the instance, stop the instance
	-   Create an EBS Snapshot of the instance
	-   Change the security group to only allow *NECESSARY* traffic to investigate forensically
	-   Apply forensics to the EBS snapshot securely, in an isolated environment

-   Remember, it is best practice to use AWS accounts for individual applications/business units to reduce blast radius, this comes up a lot
-   There were usually two blatantly incorrect answers, and two answers that seem like they could be correct, with one of those being the correct answer
-   Sometimes, you'll get questions asking you about the property of an AWS service. Other questions on the test might actually *give* you the answer, so remember that when going through and flagging questions
